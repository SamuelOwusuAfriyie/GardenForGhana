              Yamoransa, Ghana is a food insecure coastal village. Children lack nutrients found in fresh fruits/vegetables. The original Savannah/ tree canopy is gone to make charcoal for cooking and severe hillside erosion and lost top soils have resulted. Without rainwater capture and storage, it is not possible to farm in the dry season. California Native Garden Foundation (CNGF), an ecological education/training/research non-profit, created Garden For Ghana (GFG) to address these concerns. With the assistance of unemployed village youth formed into a Green Club, CNGF has built seven gardens at schools in Yamoransa and created rainwater capture and storage systems.  A junior green club composed of students from village middle schools is committed to growing the crops in the gardens and teaching students at participating schools how to help with this work.   Using the Earth Heroes Badge program from CNGF, and in partnership with college interns, community members and mentors, schools teach science lessons and other lessons on the teaching farms.The harvests supply the school lunch programs.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify drop display-none" id='drop'>  <img class="left" src="https://i.imgur.com/lYboXq5.jpg"/>The project utilizes powerful techniques in regenerative organic agriculture to maximize crop yields and improve nutrition in fruits and vegetables grown while improving biodiversity and returning carbon to the soil.  Techniques used include: no till agriculture, poly culture, native hedgerows, heirloom seed saving, composting and vermicomposting, rainwater harvest, biogas, alternative power, and mounding.  These techniques eliminate the need for expensive and damaging fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.
As many as 30 different crops are grown, including eggplant, okra, peanuts, cowpeas, basil, carrots, pigeon peas, Malabar spinach, papaya, guava, mango, avocado, banana, plantain, pineapple, and Moringa tree.
Management techniques are taught, including making budgets and projections, keeping journals, and developing reports on quantities of food harvested and sold.  Sustainability goals are set and measured, also.
Villagers helped CNGF restore local ecosystems by building silt fences and replanting native grasses and trees on a demonstration erosion control garden and food forest that stopped all runoff in that area.
Growing orange-fleshed sweet potato is of special importance, as it counteracts Vitamin A deficiency.
Success is achieved by many local and global partners working together to achieve common goals.  People from many different backgrounds are planning, digging, composting, planting and teaching and learning together to make a difference.

          <p class=" text-justify drop ">American Field Service helped establish the first local Green Club with youth who had graduated from school and hadn't yet found jobs or gone on to university.  In partnership with University of Cape Coast students in the Department of Public Health and Population Studies, the Green Club built the first gardens in Yamoransa, Ghana and formed a base of community support.  Once the gardens were built, it was suggested that middle school students form Junior Green Clubs (JGC) to take over growing the food and to perform any necessary improvements and repairs.   The JGC students wear club shirts and earn Earth Heroes nature badges while completing farm projects and learning about farm management and agricultural targets. A project manager visits all garden plots weekly and meets with the JGC and teachers to address any challenges and include the solutions in the monthly work plan.Junior Green Club members have become mentors to other children, teaching primary school students and their own classmates from middle schools how to plant seeds, save seeds, monitor and tend plants, and harvest food.

              In 2014, six sites were located, fenced and secured, and soil organic content was built up. A well was dug, and roof rainwater capture systems were put in place. Composting in place was performed by placing alternating layers of aged manure and plantain leaves and allowing the rains to decompose the pile over a period of several months.  Planting beds were created by forming four-foot mounds with pathways between.

During the four years since the first school gardens were built in Yamoransa, annual business reports produced by the project manager have been presented to CNGF and school and town leadership.  Depending on the soils, Regenerative organic agriculture (ROA) can be five- to ten-times more productive than either organic or conventional farming.  At harvest feasts, students receive rewards and recognition for goals met, new projects begun, challenges addressed, and new partners gained.

The GFG model has also inspired many in Yamoransa to create their own farm plots, including elected officials, teachers, and members of the village elder council. They have used ROA methods and their own resources to build and manage their plots.

            One hundred trees have been planted in the seven gardens now growing at two participating schools in Yamoransa.  Six of the gardens are used for growing food, and one is a propagation garden.  Altogether, the gardens occupy a half acre or more and make an important contribution to school lunch programs.

            Regenerative farms have higher yields.  They create drought-resistant soil by building soil organic matter, which increases the water-holding capacity of the soil.  They improve biodiversity by creating conditions that allow plants and animals to thrive.  They also increase carbon held in soil.

            By obtaining some fencing, a source of carbon, nitrogen-fixing leaves from local trees, and seeds that haven't been chemically treated (such as those CNGF supplies from seed banks) any villager can start a regenerative agriculture farm.  The farm can be kept going year-round, season after season, simply by practicing seed saving and using rainwater storage and capture techniques.

            As students and villagers learn to practice regenerative farming, and share this knowledge with others, the results are: improved nutrition, water conservation, increased biodiversity, help in reversing climate change and in increasing biodiversity, and a boost to local economies.

          <h3>Crop Education</h3>
          <p>The gardens grow comfort foods, like corn, groundnuts, okra, and green pepper.  Each plant has its own purpose.  Drought-tolerant plants and perennials are grown to conserve water.  Superfood plants and native plants like cowpeas and okra are grown to help with nutrition, as are orange-flesh sweet potatoes, developed by Ghana Farm Extension to help fight childhood vitamin A deficiencies.  Other plants fix nitrogen; all selections help fight climate change by improving soils, conserving water and delivering high nutrition without requiring chemical fertilizers.  Leaves of nitrogen-fixing trees and compost replace manure.  Nitrogen-fixing perennial shrubs, like pigeon peas, are planted in native hedgerows alongside crop mounds to help manage insect pests.  Perennial foods, like Malabar spinach, provide fresh spinach year-round without repeated plantings.

Planting with native plants and using native grasses in hedgerows improves biodiversity and attracts more pollinators to help increase pollination in the food plants.</p>
